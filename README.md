## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Currently, there is a lack of an easy and efficient solution for setting up and monitoring tournaments on-chain. Existing solutions in the web2 space do not provide the necessary visibility into the distribution of funds and the actual games played during the tournament. This creates challenges in terms of transparency and accountability.

Moreover, the process of manually distributing rewards by event organizers is complicated, especially when regulatory requirements come into play. Using platforms like Stripe to distribute prize money introduces additional complexities and potential compliance issues.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
To address the first problem, we have developed a comprehensive solution that enables the generation of game brackets for tournament participants. This ensures clarity on the stages of the tournament and the progress of players. By leveraging blockchain technology, we provide a transparent and secure platform for organizing and tracking tournaments.

Additionally, we have implemented an automated reward distribution smart contract to alleviate the burden on tournament organizers. This smart contract takes care of distributing rewards to the winners, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the potential for fund mismanagement. By leveraging blockchain's immutable and auditable nature, we ensure the integrity and fairness of the reward distribution process.

Overall, our solution aims to revolutionize tournament organization by providing an efficient and transparent platform for setting up and monitoring tournaments on-chain. Through automated reward distribution and enhanced visibility, we strive to streamline the tournament experience for organizers and participants alike, while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
